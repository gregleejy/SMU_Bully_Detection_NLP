SMU Confess Bullying Detection - Sentiment Analysis Project

Project Overview

This project aims to detect targeted bullying remarks in the Telegram group chat SMU Confess using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The model identifies harmful messages using sentiment analysis and flags messages that could be considered bullying. The ultimate goal is to create a safer online space by applying AI-powered text classification.

Motivation

Online bullying and harassment are serious concerns in anonymous group chats. SMU Confess, being a platform for anonymous sharing, can sometimes host harmful messages. This project was built to identify and flag those messages using sentiment analysis, ensuring a safer environment.

Technologies Used

	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries/Frameworks:
	•	NLP: Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK, spaCy
	•	Machine Learning: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
	•	Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
	•	Web Scraping: Telethon API
	•	Deployment: Streamlit, Flask, Heroku

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SMU_Bully_Detection_NLP.git
cd SMU_Bully_Detection_NLP


	2.	Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows


	3.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Model Development

	1.	Data Collection: Extract Telegram chat data using Telethon API.
	2.	Data Preprocessing: Clean, tokenize, and prepare data.
	3.	Model Training: Train models like BERT or DistilBERT.
	4.	Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.

Usage

	•	To run the project locally:

streamlit run app.py


	•	Example Command Line Prediction:

from transformers import pipeline
sentiment_model = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
result = sentiment_model("You are such a loser!")
print(result)

Future Improvements

	•	Fine-tune the BERT model on a custom bullying detection dataset.
	•	Add multi-language support for global user interaction.
	•	Improve accuracy using ensemble learning methods.
